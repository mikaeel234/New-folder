<div id="section2" class="container-fluid bg-warning" style="padding:100px 20px;">
  <h1 class="text-center">E-Learning</h1>
  <p class="p-3">E-learning -- also called electronic learning or web-based training -- is anywhere, anytime instruction delivered over the internet or a corporate intranet to students and other learners via a browser.</p>
  <img class="rounded"
   src="img5.png" alt="">
  <p class="p-3">Contrary to traditional learning methods, e-learning lets students, employees in training and casual learners participate in an organized learning experience regardless of their physical location.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
  <h1 class="text-center">E-Books</h1>
  <p class="p-3">An ebook (short for electronic book), also spelled as e-book or eBook, is a book publication made available in electronic form, consisting of text, images, or both, readable on the flat-panel display of computers or other electronic devices.[1] Although sometimes defined as "an electronic version of a printed book",[2] some e-books exist without a printed equivalent.</p>
  <img class="rounded"

  <p class="p-3"> E-books can be read on dedicated e-reader devices, also on any computer device that features a controllable viewing screen, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.</p>
